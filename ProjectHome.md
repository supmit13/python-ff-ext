Purpose and Scope: This document lays out the overall design of an application that allows a web surfer using Mozilla Firefox web browser to save the URL that he/she is currently visiting on the internet to a web-based database centric application that allows him/her later to share his/her visited URLs with other users.

Since this type of a web-based application would require the user to be registered with the web application that will serve him/her with the facility of saving visited URLs, this document will also lay out the structure of the database that will store user information (that would be used by the system to identify a specific user uniquely) as well as the information that an  user will be allowed to store in order to access and share visited URLs conveniently.
