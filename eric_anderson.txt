Hello Supriyo, 



Congratulations on winning this project! I look forward to working with you!!! 



As you know, I was interested to start this project with a database design for approval before building. I captured some requirements and notes below to aid your database design.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  If so, I can set up a kick off call (no more than 1 hour) for us to discuss the wireframes and the notes and get on the same page. 



Kind regards, 

Eric Anderson

COMPONENTS 



a firefox extension that saves URLs to a web based user account 

a small web-based Django app for users to access saved URLs 



the primary objective is to build a firefox extension that allows the user to: 



i) install the extension on a macintosh or PC; 

ii) set up a savewhatyoulookedat.com user account; 

iii) save URLs and associated data attributes/values to their account 

iv) share those URLs with friends; 



DATA 



A user account will have four attributes: 



i) id; 

i) email address; 

ii) password; 

iii) account created timestamp (gmt); 



A saved URL will have these attributes: 



i) URL 

ii) HTML doc and images from the URL (to prevent rot, esp @ CL); 

iii) timestamp for time saved (gmt) 

iv) all email addresses listed on the page; 

v) user ids that have saved the URL, 

vi) user ids that have “opted in” to receive more info/updates; 

vii) Category (can be unique at the user level); 





There will need to be a table of possible Categories as well.  You can see in the wireframes that a user can categorize the URLs that save, and then save entire Categories with friends.  These table should be initialized with these attributes: 



i) id; 

ii) category (initial values: apartment, house, car, vacation rental, shoes, purse, book); 

iii) create date;
