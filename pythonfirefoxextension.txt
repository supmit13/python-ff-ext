Cover Letter: Hi,

I can do this for you. I have done something similar, though not using python, but using perl. I shall provide you with a stripped up version in a short while. I cannot provide the entire source code for the work I had done, since I am bound by licensing matters. Let me know if you want to know anything more.

Regards,
Supriyo   
 
Requested Interview: October 9, 2009  
Interview Invitation: Hi Supriyo,

Thanks for bidding!  I appreciated your bid and would like to get started.  I just wanted to confirm that we might do three things as part of this project - and that that does not change your scope:

i)  use the django framework;
ii) have a "kick off" call to walk through the wireframe and functionality for 1 - 2 hours over Skype to confirm functionality and deliverables.

If those things seem okay, please let me know.

Thanks!
Eric
